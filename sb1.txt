Limitions with Spring Framework 
================================
In spring framework a programmer is responsible for following things.

1) Adding the dependencies or jar files

2) Performing the configurations in applicationContext.xml file.

3) Arranging physical server like Tomcat.

4) Managing physical database like Oracle.

To overcome this above limitations we need to use spring boot.

ex:
		Developer
		    |
		    |
		Spring Boot

		    |
		Spring Framework 

Spring Boot
============
It is a java based application framework developed by Pivotal Team.

It provides RAD (Rapid Application Development) features to spring based applications.

It is a standalone , production ready grade spring based applications with minimum configurations.

In short, spring boot is a combination of 


	spring framework	+	Embedded server		+	Embedded Database 

Spring Boot does not support XML operations.Instead we will use annotations.



Advantages of Spring Boot
==========================
It is used to develop standalone application which can run by using java -jar.

It provides production ready grade features like metrix, healthcheck , externalized configurations
and etc.

It provides optionate starters to simply the maven development process.

It allows us to test web application by using HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow.

It provides In-memory databases like H2, HSQL and Derby.

It does not support xml configurations.

It contains CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for developing and testing spring boot applications.


Interview Questions
====================

Q) How many components are there in spring boot?

We have four impotant components in spring boot.

1) Autoconfiguration 

2) Starters

3) Actuators 

4) CLI tool



Q) What is dependency injection ? 

It is a programmatic technique which makes our class independent to it's dependencies.

It is a programmatic technique where one object will pass the dependencies of another.

To perform dependency injection in spring boot we will use @Autowired annotation.

ex:
	class Recordings
	{
		-
		- //some logic 
		-
	}
	class Student
	{
		@Autowired
		Recordings r;
	}

Q) In how many ways we can develop spring boot project?

There are two ways to develop spring boot project.

1) Using Spring Initializr 
	
2) Using IDE's (Spring Tool Suit(STS) / Intellij)
